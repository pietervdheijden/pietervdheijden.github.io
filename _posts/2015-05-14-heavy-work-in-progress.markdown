title: Hello, World!

Quoted from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program): "_As all programmers probably know, Hello World! is basically the name you give to your first application when discovering a new programming language._" 
Let this post be my 'Hello, World!' application to the 'blogging language'. 

## Who am I?

Let me start by introducing myself: I'm Pieter van der Heijden, 20 years old, student Computer Science at the Technical University of Eindhoven, freelance software developer at VCF Software Solutions, soccer player at VOAB 1, programming enthousiast and a lot more. I have a lovely girlfriend, called Juliette.

## Why blogging?

Since I just started to work on contract, I discovered the difficulty and need to be found on the internet. Apparently, there are a lot Pieter van der Heijden's out there. 

In addition, I always enjoy the posts of other people out there and want to give something back to the community.  

That's why I started this blog; to increase my reputation on the internet by sharing my thoughts and experiences. Among others this implies being ranked first when someone searches for 'Pieter van der Heijden' on his favorite search engine. The moment I achieve this [SEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization), I will ofcourse write an in-depth post about my experiences.

## What topics?

The topics will mainly be concerned with programming matters. For example, see the next section.

## This blog

I constructed this blog using GitHub Pages + Jekyll. So far I really enjoy this combination, since:

1. You have access to the CDN of GitHub Pages.
This means your page will be loaded super fast everywhere in the world.

2. No need for (slow) databases!
Seems silly to create whole databases when you only have static content right? Since we're not using databases, the blog will also be a lot faster (compare this blog to a random WordPress blog and you know what I mean :) ).

3. Amazing template functions from Jekyll.
Less code reuse and a more clear structure to your program.

4. Wide variety of themes available.
I'm using the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme, but this is only one of the many available themes. See for example [JekyllThemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/).

5. There are many resources out there.
Since everyone hosts it on GitHub (mostly in public repositories), there are many resources available. This means you can easily see how others constructed their GitHub Pages.

These are only a few of the nice things about this combination. For more detailed information see the documentation of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
